      "Comment 15: Im 5&#39;4&quot;, I bounce between 160–170lbs, I workout maybe 5–10 times a month, but I look to be about average with a flat muffin top. I can confirm, that people of average height and strong physique get absolutely confused when they see me lift or pull the same weight as them. They ask what I do for training and they get even more confused whe I tell them my &#39;routine&#39;.<br>     But my true secrets to maintaining my health without working out all the time is labor. I was a landscaper for almost a year, enough time on the job to confidentiality develop lifelong skills, and I still use them to improve my mom and grandparents. I dig up dirt and clay, planted entire 5 year old trees, moved countless bags of soil and cement, its like doing a workout for 6–8 hours with varying rest times and exercises. <br>     Another factor that I believe plays into my strength is my mental fortitude. I spent the first 5 years of my adult life  as an active duty Marine Infantryman. I was amongst one of the shortest, and aesthetically one of the smallest, so Im always putting in double effort just to keep up with the average sized Marines. Ive carried 80lbs of weight over 20 miles with overly blistered feet during battalion rucks. Whenever we did 1v1 sparring I always picked the guys twice my size just to raise the morale of my platoon and give them something entertaining to watch. I would rarely ever win, but my opponents would always become gassed out by the end of it. Ive carried average sized people over my shoulders with full gear on both myself and my partner during medevac drills. We would run 3–6 miles in stabbing, ice cold –20*F weather every winter. I essentially lived in my 30+lbs worth of gear every time we did practical training. <br>     Ive always been of the belief that strength is determined moreso by the fortitude of your mind rather than your muscles.\n",

Just finding movements that are challenging in themselves to you, but are manageable, and doing them with full focus once (what i do) a day over time can lead to massive improvements. The trick is to find a good base exercise to do and totally master it before you move on to other things. And when i say master i mean sometimes ill spend more than a year or two doing something as simple as a specific stretch before i do anything with that movement, but will attempt it each time with the mentality of perfect form and as i improve try little variations within the movement.\n",

I just finished my first season of varsity track and field, and the main thing that made me faster was doing tons of starts (that is, the most explosive part of the run) at about 70% effort. <br>I was trying to perfect my form, but ultimately the gains I got from it seemed bigger than just form.

For prove start doing 5 sets of 10 reps near failure instead of 5 sets of 3 reps and measure your muscles diameter before and couple of weeks after the experiment.\n",

      "Comment 91: Recruitment.  It is also the reason why some athletes have more powerful bursts, like faster sprinting or higher jumping.  It is a reason why Eastern weightlifters don&#39;t call it weightlifting, they call it strength training.  They believe what is far more important than lifting the weight is that you are training your mind to recruit more muscle, not just necessarily putting on more muscle.<br><br>  More scientifically, you are increasing the number of contractile neurons in the specific parts of your cerebellum responsible for those specific movements.  The reason why this works is because most of your muscle is dormant, either it is repairing, is tired, or requires more complex coordination than your cerebellum is currently capable of providing.  So most people only use like 15% of their muscle fibers.  If you perform an exercise every single day you will work through every single fiber eventually because the ones that are repairing that day, or are still tired, won&#39;t get used, so you use new ones.  When your cerebellum gets a chance to work every single muscle fiber then it becomes easy for it to get them all coordinated on a single effort.<br><br>  Having perfect form isn&#39;t about looks, it is about consistency and mastery over movements.  If you use bad form repeatedly you can get strong too, but eventually when you do that in front of people you will feel silly because that form doesn&#39;t look good, then you will change to an attractive form that you haven&#39;t trained your brain to do, and have greatly reduced capability.  Sometimes &quot;good form&quot; is because it actually does reduce injuries to joints or whatever, but sometimes it is just because it is aesthetically pleasing.  It doesn&#39;t actually matter which it is, whether you change your form mid-game to avoid injury, or to not move in a silly way, either way you are trying a new movement that you never trained.  It is best to just use good form, even if you disagree with it right now, it will eventually feel like the right one to you and you will have wasted all the time training in bad form.\n",

      "Comment 93: being strong and being powerful is not the same...<br><br>Being strong and being powerful are related concepts, but they have distinct meanings. <br><br>Strength typically refers to the physical capacity to exert force or lift heavy objects. It is often associated with muscular power and endurance. Strength can be measured by how much weight a person can lift or how much force they can exert.<br><br>Power, on the other hand, can refer to both physical and mental capabilities. In a physical sense, power is often seen as the ability to generate force quickly, resulting in explosive movements. Power involves strength, but it also includes speed and coordination. <br><br>In a broader sense, power can also refer to influence, authority, or control over a situation or others. A person who is powerful may not necessarily be physically strong, but they have the ability to influence or impact others or their environment.<br><br>In summary, strength is more about physical capability, while power can encompass both physical and mental attributes, including influence and control.\n",

FlexMobStab witch is flexibility, mobility and stability to improve my health, 4.then the low 1-3 reps, 3 setf of singles, doubles and tripples. i will alternate every week in a 4 week circle, combining classical calisthenics (body weight training) and the use of mashines (i dont have a barbell at my home gym) <br>and after doing this routine for 4 times wich are 12 weeks, i will give an update on how its going - save the video to look at this later... and btw i just recently read about a so called phycho trigger (mostly used in the 4th type of my training) where when im already fatiquing, after the break i do a specific movement, breave a specific way and say something to myself or whenever possible saying it out loud or whispering it, after done so, i use all my power i have in my body and use as much force as possible. same with reaction time training and logical thinking ability. this preperation sets an anchor. whenever i do the things, my body, brain and vision sharpens and gets ready to be stressed...<br>so whenever needed, i can do the breathing/movement and say the word (witch are just some letters attatched to each others that sound cool but have no meaning) and be ready for everything, completely shattering my limits. this is a self test and i have no idea if that works but after talking to a phychologist, i was informed that there are no downsides and deep breathing even helps you calming down and increase the blood oxygen level. if done over long time, the anchor/trigger might actually work and when done the specific breathing-movement-word technique, the subconscious will be triggered, shattering the limits for thinking-speed, lowering reaction time, increasing speed, strength, visual stuff (you can train the FPS of your vision and the tiny muscles in your eyes) decreasing stress and increasing your overall observation. whenever used the trigger, give 120% and try as hard as possible. so when in danger, you can use the trigger and you got a plus 20% buff on all your stats (like a boost in a game). the thing is... it actually works, try it yourself. there are no downsides.

Went from 5 to 10 pullups. 60 to 65 pounds on my back push ups for 5 instead of 2.

And I can do 30 pound weighted dips for 8-10 instead of 15 without weight.

Do you realize that after a while you can ride a bike without even being aware of all the movements you are performing, as if your body is managing the balancing and pedaling speed while your conscience thoughts are free to navigate the road. That&#39;s muscle memory. It applies to everything, even professional jobs and exercise. In this case training your muscles to lift weights heavier then what your body should be capable of.....if you don&#39;t get it look up YouTube videos on Indian or Bangladeshi construction laborers lifting bricks. Downside to muscle memory is your body cannot bulk up if it learns to distribute weight during exercise hence your gains always plateau once you have repeated an exercise at a certain weight enough times. At that point you have to shock your body into relearning the dynamics of the exercise by adding more weight to the exercise or tweaking the movement pattern. When that happens the brain has to reassess which muscle has to take how much minimum stress to perform the required action. Honestly it his is not a new concept and is the primary means of gaining muscle mass for body builders who may not know the mechanics of what they are doing but know that what they are doing works!\n",

It’s the matter of weight classes secretly being height classes in powerlifting/olylifting.<br><br>I’ve been lifting weights for 5 years, and doubled my bodyweight at 6’4 135-215. After putting on size I brought my 40 yard dash down to a 4.7, learned to dunk, as well as easily squatting/deadlifting past the 4 plate range, banging out weighted pull-ups for reps, one arm push-ups, as well as power cleaning close to 3 plates.  <br><br>Size helps, and size matters. Don’t let anyone tell you different. <br><br>There will be cases of a small guy being stronger than a big guy but you gotta factor in how lean the small guy is as opposed to the big guy, is the big guy training properly, or have the fundamentals of athleticism and functionality down, as well as being used to whatever test of strength that the small guy does (in the context that the small guy is well conditioned to being good at that one specific action.) too many factors and variables <br><br>For example: my short friend who’s 60lbs lighter than me is insanely stronger than me at lifting, however I beat him in wrestling and basketball all the time (in post ups/back downs.)<br><br>I have another friend who’s way faster than me because he runs track but he couldn’t lift nearly as heavy as me and is weak on the field.<br><br>I have another friend who’s insane at physical labor but couldn’t do shi as an o-line/d-line, and I mess him up in the paint at basketball.<br><br>I have a cousin who’s insanely strong and athletic in football but can’t box for shit or wrestle. <br><br>The list goes on.

The problem is that I can&#39;t sacrifice my plan to try this for 8 weeks so it would definitely break that rule where I should be doing this alone, I guess. Other than that, sprinting can be a more complex movement than pullups when you want to maintain a good form, making sure your posture, your cadence, your arm swings, your breathing and other factors are all good quality so I&#39;m not sure if this approach can actually be beneficial but it&#39;s certainly easier to keep track of all those things at 35%-80% effort than at the end of a training session when you&#39;re just trying to finish as best as you can\n",

      "Comment 271: You don&#39;t need to spend months to prove neuro-muscular adaptation - you can prove it in one workout. After you warm up, get in a squat rack and put a <i>lot</i> of weight on the bar. More than you should even try to squat for your first set. Then just lift it off the rests...and wait. Just hold it for a minute. No squatting. Just stand there. It should be enough weight that it will be hard to hold it for too long. Do this twice. Now lower the weight, stretch and do your normal squats. You might be surprised how much stronger you got from three minutes of &quot;lifting&quot;. The result is from neurologic adaptation. <br><br>Please use safeties when you do this. I don&#39;t even step out. I just lift the bar 1-2 inches above the rests. That&#39;s all it takes. It also works for bench and several other compound movements. I have never had luck using it for isolation movements, but maybe you&#39;ll do better. I also pad the bar to prevent my shoulders from feeling sore from the bar.\n",

The primary stimulus driving hypertrophy is mechanical tension, which is why they all emphasize the eccentric phase of the lift, really control the weight on the way down and feel a deep stretch on the bottom. Your muscles as a result don’t necessary break apart even at the micro scale, but they have received the stimulus to trigger the adaptation for hypertrophy.

Both of which probably play a huge roll in his weight lifting prowess.<br><br>Tendons are what lets you jerk a weight around and not have your muscle tear off your bone.

We all have both but the fast twitch muscle fiber is responsible for explosive power or extreme short burst energy the individual has . These fibers or muscle type will tire out faster . Slow twitch end of the spectrum will possibly grow larger to get to the same strength but can do more repetitive and longer intervals. Ultimately genetics play the role of what your body has more of. I personally have the small frame and more fast twitch. You have to be careful because your muscles are able to exceed what tendons and ligaments are capable of when you really push it and can lead to being injury. I had a surgeon tell me they thought their scalpel was dull and asked for a new one with no change going through my abdominal region. Told me they have never cut through muscle that dense in their entire career. I&#39;m 5&#39;9&quot; 165 lbs lean swimmer build\n",

You can definitely build a lot of strength through all the techniques he describes, but you’re going to hit a wall or max and never pass the amateur or novice level.   it’s pretty simple muscle moves things, so if you really want to get actually strong, you should probably spend a lot of years doing hypertrophy training and adding pounds of muscle to your frame. Then, once you practice all these other strength techniques, you will surpass any limit you would have faced otherwise.  It’s not rocket science look at elite level powerlifters or Olympic weightlifters. They pretty much look like bodybuilders.
